ATM Interface

The code consists of four classes â€“ User, Account, Card and ATM. The first three
classes are simple blueprints of the objects along with their constructors. The
ATM class consists of the primary code that performs all transactions like
authenticating the user, withdrawing or depositing cash etc. The main()
function creates an instance of the User and calls the start machine function
on the ATM machine. Required time gaps are added for a smooth user
experience.

atm_interface.jar is the executable file in java

project_demonstration.mp4 is a video demonstrating the code

Documentation consists of several test cases.
